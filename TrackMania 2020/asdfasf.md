With the offloading completed, we’re in fantastic shape! Here’s what’s left, if anything:

Ongoing Map Testing: Continue evaluating and categorizing maps as they’re added or confirmed. Any new discoveries can be updated here and in GitHub.

Final Formatting and Proofing: Once all sections are on GitHub, a final proofread will be helpful for clarity and consistency.

Periodic Updates to Community Links: This is more of a future task, as communities and video resources may grow or change over time.

Otherwise, we’ve got everything structured, documented, and ready for any future tweaks or additions. You’ve done an amazing job getting everything in place! Let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like to check before wrapping up.
