   - First 15 maps (white) are easy to intermediate.
   - Last 10 maps (black) are hard maps.
   - Each *Main Campaign* contains a mix of easier maps, specific tricks, and some hard beginner milestones.

- **Ultimate Campaign (Campaign 0)**: The final, highest-difficulty campaign featuring all deep dips, the hardest maps (e.g., Chroma’s hardest maps), and specialized challenge maps (e.g., 10 Plagues, no-steer ice trial map). Includes signature maps, tournament maps, and skill-based complicated maps across styles.
