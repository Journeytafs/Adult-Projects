# Reinstalling Kenshi: From Messy Mods to a Masterpiece

So, the time finally came to reinstall Kenshi—a game where you can spend hours going from nothing to something, from zero to hero... you get the picture. But it’s also an older game, and once you realize it supports mods, it opens a whole new world. With years for mods to mature, this journey was bound to be incredible.

Fast-forward a week into the process. I had 4 mod collections, 2 updated versions of those, and a bundle that merges several into one. I had articles from Reddit, a folder stuffed with Workshop mods, installation files like Vulkan and shaders, fixes, load order rules—basically, bits of information spread across a ton of sites. That’s when the powerhouse came in: **ChatGPT**.

In about 4 days, ChatGPT took all that mess and helped me craft a clean, optimized install guide with tips, tricks, and a seamless load order. It turned into a dream setup, something that would’ve taken days of trial and error if I’d done it alone. I’m new to AI, but seeing it turn random knowledge and scattered resources into an organized project—it’s incredible. I wouldn’t have made this reality without it.

And Kenshi? It’s a fantastic game that invites endless tinkering. But here’s the truth: it’s old. What draws me in is the modding. So, to the modding enthusiasts out there—**get organized, use ChatGPT**, and take the process of digging through info and convert it into work you’re proud of. Doesn’t matter your weak spots—grammar, syntax, even ideas—just dive in. It’s like working with a thousand minds at once.

> A quick note on limits: Yes, there are free and paid versions of AI tools depending on the scope of your project. I eventually upgraded because the free version helped so much that I knew I wanted more. So give it a shot, have fun, and dive into the possibilities!
