Additional To-Do Suggestions

1. Player Engagement Enhancements

Player Tips & Tricks Section:

Beyond a Trick List, consider adding a small section with “Pro Tips” for difficult maps. Brief insights (one-liners) like “Stay centered on turns to avoid drift” for specific maps or challenges could be popular.


Map “Easter Egg” Highlights:

Highlight a few quirky details or fun “easter eggs” in certain maps to make them memorable. This could be a fun addition to each campaign description, adding character to the project.



2. Visual & UI Refinements

Mini Map Thumbnails:

Create mini thumbnails for each campaign to display in the selection menu. This could enhance the visual appeal of the campaign menu, giving players a quick “snapshot” of each campaign’s vibe.


Campaign Theme Colors:

Use theme colors for each campaign’s descriptions or borders to keep each one distinct. For instance, use cool tones for ice, warm tones for nascar, etc. It’s a small touch that adds continuity and makes each campaign easily identifiable.



3. Community & Social Integration

Social Media Preview Post Templates:

If you’re sharing the project on social channels, consider creating short, templated posts. A quick image, campaign summary, or a “Map of the Week” spotlight could add excitement and generate buzz around the project.


Feedback Polls & Player Choice Options:

Build a feedback poll (for example, “Favorite Campaign?”) to engage the community and collect data on popular campaigns or maps. You could integrate this into a Notion or even link it on GitHub if community involvement is a focus.



4. Process & Maintenance Automation

Map Tagging System:

Implement a color-coded or icon-based tagging system in Notion (or GitHub labels) for maps. This would be helpful for quick visual filtering (e.g., “Training,” “Endurance,” “Niche Style”). It’s a nice way to make tracking status even more efficient.


Automated Progress Tracking:

If possible, set up basic automation in Notion or GitHub that updates completion statuses, such as “In Testing,” “Awaiting Description,” or “Ready to Release.” This is a time-saver that gives a bird’s-eye view of progress at a glance.



5. Optional Expansions & Future Add-Ons

Player Challenges or Achievement Goals:

Add challenges like “Complete the Nascar Campaign with no crashes” or “Speedrun Ice Maps in under X minutes.” These could be fun stretch goals to engage competitive players.


Map Storylines:

If you want to add more narrative, create short backstories for milestone maps. It’s an immersive element that could make the project feel more like a journey.

1. Trackmania Project with Strategic Charm:

Campaign Flow & Imagery: Populate placeholders for map lists, descriptions, and images, layering in vibrant visuals for each campaign map. Elevate the presentation with details that make the campaign memorable and immersive.

Objective Highlights: Outline objectives or notable quirks for each map, spotlighting the skills and tricks involved. It’s all about making the journey enticing.

Niche Campaign Refinement: Hone in on unique map styles—RPG, LOL, trial maps. A touch of allure for each style, so each feels like a hidden treasure.

Map Assessment & Categorization: Dive into testing and sorting—campaigns or rejections. Add final touches before GitHub upload and proofing, making sure every choice feels deliberate.

Author Highlights: Each map creator gets their spotlight. Ensure contributions shine and make special notes of milestone creators.

Tricks of the Trade: Capture clever techniques in a dedicated list, turning each trick into a guide-worthy nugget.

2. Finalize Campaign Descriptions with Narrative Flow:

Campaign Descriptions with a Pull: Craft descriptions that don’t just inform but invite—give each campaign a pulse that aligns with gameplay notes.

Image Asset Creation: Design and compress visual assets, test in Trackmania to ensure they dazzle without a hitch.


3. Documentation & Community Building in GitHub:

Update & Polish: Transfer sections with polished Markdown formatting, ensuring everything is accessible and aesthetically sharp.

Guide Texts with a Wink: Proofread with an eye for clarity and subtle intrigue, adding teaser quotes to each campaign.

4. Community & Video Links with Curated Flair:

Curated Content Selection: Videos categorized by technique, style, and community relevance—adding depth and resources for every kind of player.

Feedback Portal: Draft a feedback system that makes it easy for players to offer insights, creating a loop of continuous improvement.


5. Future Ideas & Inspirations:

Potential Campaign Expansions: Brainstorm potential maps, milestones, and techniques to explore. Every future idea becomes a ‘maybe’ that sparks excitement.
