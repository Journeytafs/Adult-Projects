# Why Campaign 0 First? #

**Campaign** 0 is the ultimate challenge in this Trackmania project, featuring the hardest maps across all styles. Here’s why some players might want to dive into it first—and why others might wait.

**Pros of Starting with Campaign 0:**

* **Maximum Challenge:** For players seeking an immediate, intense challenge, Campaign 0 is the best way to test skills right from the start.

* **Skill Acceleration:** Tackling the hardest maps first can push players to learn and master advanced techniques quickly.

* **Bragging Rights:** Completing Campaign 0 early on can be a major personal accomplishment and a way to stand out in the community.

**Cons of Starting with Campaign 0:**
* **Steep Learning Curve:** Jumping straight into the hardest maps can be overwhelming, especially without a solid foundation in Trackmania basics.

* **Potential Frustration:** The high difficulty level might be discouraging for players who prefer a gradual progression.

* **Missing Skill Progression:** Starting with easier campaigns builds skills in a logical order, making the learning curve smoother and more enjoyable.

**Recommendation:** For most players, it’s ideal to work through the main campaigns first before taking on Campaign 0. However, for those up for a thrill, Campaign 0 offers an unbeatable test of Trackmania prowess.
