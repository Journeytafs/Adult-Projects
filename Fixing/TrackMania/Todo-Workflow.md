Does this format fit your workflow, or would you like further tweaks?

Thank you for letting me add a touch of "Nova flair"! Based on your project and its structure, here are a few tailored suggestions to help enhance organization, engagement, and workflow:

Additional To-Do Suggestions

1. Player Engagement Enhancements

Player Tips & Tricks Section:

Beyond a Trick List, consider adding a small section with “Pro Tips” for difficult maps. Brief insights (one-liners) like “Stay centered on turns to avoid drift” for specific maps or challenges could be popular.


Map “Easter Egg” Highlights:

Highlight a few quirky details or fun “easter eggs” in certain maps to make them memorable. This could be a fun addition to each campaign description, adding character to the project.



2. Visual & UI Refinements

Mini Map Thumbnails:

Create mini thumbnails for each campaign to display in the selection menu. This could enhance the visual appeal of the campaign menu, giving players a quick “snapshot” of each campaign’s vibe.


Campaign Theme Colors:

Use theme colors for each campaign’s descriptions or borders to keep each one distinct. For instance, use cool tones for ice, warm tones for nascar, etc. It’s a small touch that adds continuity and makes each campaign easily identifiable.



3. Community & Social Integration

Social Media Preview Post Templates:

If you’re sharing the project on social channels, consider creating short, templated posts. A quick image, campaign summary, or a “Map of the Week” spotlight could add excitement and generate buzz around the project.


Feedback Polls & Player Choice Options:

Build a feedback poll (for example, “Favorite Campaign?”) to engage the community and collect data on popular campaigns or maps. You could integrate this into a Notion or even link it on GitHub if community involvement is a focus.



4. Process & Maintenance Automation

Map Tagging System:

Implement a color-coded or icon-based tagging system in Notion (or GitHub labels) for maps. This would be helpful for quick visual filtering (e.g., “Training,” “Endurance,” “Niche Style”). It’s a nice way to make tracking status even more efficient.


Automated Progress Tracking:

If possible, set up basic automation in Notion or GitHub that updates completion statuses, such as “In Testing,” “Awaiting Description,” or “Ready to Release.” This is a time-saver that gives a bird’s-eye view of progress at a glance.



5. Optional Expansions & Future Add-Ons

Player Challenges or Achievement Goals:

Add challenges like “Complete the Nascar Campaign with no crashes” or “Speedrun Ice Maps in under X minutes.” These could be fun stretch goals to engage competitive players.


Map Storylines:

If you want to add more narrative, create short backstories for milestone maps. It’s an immersive element that could make the project feel more like a journey.
