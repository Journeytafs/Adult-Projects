## **Milestone Campaigns** ##
These campaigns showcase “best of” maps and peak difficulty within a specific style. They serve as advanced training grounds for players ready to push their skills to the limit.




# What’s a Milestone Campaign? #
Milestone Campaigns are special collections of maps representing peak difficulty and skill within each style. Here’s what makes them unique:

* **Purpose:**
These campaigns highlight the most iconic, technically challenging maps in Trackmania. They’re designed for players looking to push their skills to the next level.

* **Skill Mastery:**
Each Milestone Campaign focuses on a different Trackmania style (e.g., Speedtech, Fullspeed, Nascar). They serve as both a test and a training ground for advanced techniques like SpeedSlide, Quantum Drift, and Inside Line control.

* **Curated Selection:**
Only the “best of the best” maps make it into Milestone Campaigns. Each map has been carefully chosen based on player feedback, community popularity, or technical demands.

* **Final Challenges:**
Milestone Campaigns often feature high-difficulty maps placed at the end of a style’s progression path, giving players a peak challenge in that area.
