Tricks and Techniques Section
Each campaign focuses on specific techniques to master, making it easy for players to follow a structured progression. Here’s the detailed breakdown:
This section will serve as a reference for players to refine specific skills based on the campaign they’re in.







Airtime Reduction: Techniques to control airtime, including diagonal flight and air skips.

Air Control: Basics of braking to adjust angle, left-right rotation, and reducing airtime before jumps.

SpeedSlide: For speeds above 600 in FullSpeed maps, requiring a mix of brake tapping and steering.

Quantum Drift: Specialized for dirt, grass, plastic, and slippery surfaces, with advanced setup lines for simultaneous steering and speed sliding.

Galaxy Drift: A rare full-speed drift technique involving curved momentum control.

BugSlide: Known for its tricky mechanics, often requiring sharp entry angles.

S4D: Brake-tap speed slides used in FullSpeed maps, typically covering the 430-600 speed range.

Unique Styles and Surface-Specific Techniques:

Ice: Gorilla Grip, IceSD, 90 Degree Shield.

Nascar: Releasing and Banking, to my knowledge, High Speed Control

# Techniques: Trackmania Tricks & Techniques #

## SpeedSlide ##
Maintaining speeds above 600 on fullspeed maps, with specific techniques for different speed ranges:

* **S4D (430-600 Speeds)**: Achieved with brake-tapping and full steering control.
* **Forced Speedslides**: Executed by landing from elevations and initiating a SpeedSlide directly.


# Quantum Drift #
A technique for non-road surfaces like dirt, grass, and plastic:

* **Setup**: Begin with full steer to align skid marks, then control steering to maintain the drift.
* **Execution**: Involves simultaneous full-steer and SpeedSlide techniques.
* **Note**: Mastery of unconventional racing lines is essential to set up Quantum Drifts effectively.


# Inside Line with Airtime Beats Airtime Reduction #
A high-level technique involving advanced air control:

* **Objective:** Reduce airtime while maintaining tight inside lines.
* **Key Moves:** Left-right rotation in the air and brake tapping to adjust jump angles.


# Diagonal Flight #
Commonly used by A01 hunters, this technique involves:
* **Diagonal Control:** Maintaining diagonal trajectory mid-air for optimized landings.
* **Efficiency:** May outperform straight jumps on specific tracks, though requires practice for precise control.


# Braking & Release Timing Before Jumps #
Using precise braking and release points to control jump airtime:
* **Pre-Jump Brakes:** Tapping brakes before jumps to manage airtime.
* **Controlled Release:** Strategic release of speed before airtime-heavy sections for smoother landings.


# Additional Air Control Techniques #
Mastering these allows for fine adjustments mid-air:
* **Rotation in Air:** Left-right rotation control to manage jump trajectories.
* **Braking in Mid-Air:** Slight braking to adjust angle and avoid over-shooting.
