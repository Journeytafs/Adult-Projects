Everything is designed, as much as possible, with incremental difficulty.
Basic road tricks, tech, nascar, all surfaces, substyle, niche styles and
even tricks like galaxy drift and gorilla grip will have a specific map, and will be covered.
The "intended" way, is to go from Basic concepts like elevations, steering 
and all those things we cant drive without, procceed into surfaces and when
these are in a good point,skill wise, you can go into, mixed, speedfun, etc.
Then lol, rpg and niche stytles like underwater, lol kacky or even milestones
like deep dip. You can always drive anything you like, but as this is intented for beginners, 
it is good for a small "manual" to be here.

Due to a time situation, free time,  the initial aim were to make all maps, myself, while crude, Could have been a way to complete several things at once. So here comes Time! edit, i will not be making to many maps, some to close some gaps, while i will complete this project while featuring map creators. Making this tutorial alive, and also showcasing the amazing talent, of the community. Creating a much needed, i hope this looks nice, tutorials for beginners and experts alike. We will link also as much as possible, all links to communities like, fullspeed family, ice communities, etc. As a way, to make this a nice communal hub for some practice. Have fun, I will add some details for contact ppertaining improvement ideas, and suggestions, in the meantime, hf :)

*things like dirt fullspeed, or grass tech and plastic hopping, will be sorted, by surface, until i can discover a better sorting system in here.

Everything road.
Under 600, autoslide in fullspeed.
No braking, goes to tech.
No Releasing, goes to nascar. So that leaves us with: Steer/Cornering, High Speed control, Air Control/brakes/rotation, skip airtime/diagonal flight/etc.

Really tech or technicall driving, needs no intro. But for those wanting it anyway, It used to be dominant style of older trackmanias, so alot of people are tech pros. Go Fullspeed->crash->get space->crash again->find the line and apply brakes and maximun exit speed principals->when when clear it, rinse and repeat next turn. As you guess it, easy to pick up, hard to master. Takes patience and keep in mind, for years, people played only tech, they are not magicians. Patience.
Core skills are the drifting mechanics, also when to noslide, brake and steer as oposed to steer and brake for drifing. Low speed NeoSlide is also here so, get to it. And.... Saucage. It is road with elevation it is not a surface. Road+elevation. Do you want a saucage campaign?

Tech on steroids. Featuring amazing pieces of talent, from the god Proff10 or even older gods, like Keissla. Finally Friday anyone? Due to how clustered maps are in this genre we will do part 1 and 2. Also there is a special in here, a press forward Perfect speedtech map! for your pleasure. Curtesy of Wirtual for showcasing it and the mapper of course, for creating what we, are praising.

Simple and "boring" nascar, as people might say.
It taught me how to set up that beast of a cart, for turns and helped me see the limitations of steering fullspeed and not. This and fullspeed later, will help in your judgement of when to fs and when to brake tap or release, or at least condition you a bit for it.
Simple things, like releasing and Banking and then full blown nascar action.

Loops, wallrides, Cakes, magnets, SpeedSlides from and to anywhere, S4ds, Galaxy drifting... what a name. Get ready, we will go from the basics to chroma's hell.. Joking, but an author on hideout, is required.
