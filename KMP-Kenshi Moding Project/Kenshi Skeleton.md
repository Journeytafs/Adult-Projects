supports modding. Incredible, mods had time to 
evolve, it is going to be a fantastic journey.
Arround a week inside, you got 4 collections of mods,
2 updated collections of the one we got, and one
that merges ancouple together. Some articles in 
reddit. a folder for mods of workshop, install files, like
vulkan etc. shaders, fixes, rules load order. spread across 
a ton of diffrent sites. And then comes the powerhouse.
openai, or chagpt. Took all that mess, and after about 4 
days, we created a nice install guide, with optimizations
tips, tricks, even a load order integration and it keeps getting
better. I dont know much abou Ai, relatively new to this.
but all those messy projects, and mind maps, and all 
are made quickwork with chatgpt. When i reinstalled
without consolidating all this information, took ke 2 days
and made so many mistakes, so now i present a nice
piece of work uhat came out of randomly assorted knowledge 
and an intelligent powerhouse. Incrdible, it would
have never been areality, if i made alone. 
So thanks chatgpt. Your help was invaluable.

And kenshi is great game, i can say all those things that
draws in to this game. But the truth is, ot is an old game
and you can wndlessly tinker with it.aking better or strange
or whatwver. So mod enyhusiasts, othanize your life
use chagpt, make work a conversation and a game.
and produce work you are proud off. It is like working
together with a thousand minds. Some limitation due to
paid and free models, depending on the size of your work.
But try, and buy if you need more. I bpugh for support 
and cause the free version helped ke enough to say yes
i want more. So try, have fun.

Reinstalling Kenshi: From Messy Mods to a Masterpiece

So, the time finally came to reinstall Kenshi—a game where you can spend hours going from nothing to something, from zero to hero... you get the picture. But it’s also an older game, and once you realize it supports mods, it opens a whole new world. With years for mods to mature out there, this journey was bound to be incredible.

Fast-forward a week into the process. I had 4 mod collections, 2 updated versions of those, and a bundle that merges several into one. I had articles from Reddit, a folder stuffed with Workshop mods, installation files like Vulkan and shaders, fixes, load order rules—basically, bits of information spread across a ton of sites. That’s when the powerhouse came in: ChatGPT.

In about 4 days, ChatGPT took all that mess and helped me craft a clean, optimized install guide with tips, tricks, and a seamless load order. It turned into a dream setup, something that would’ve taken days of trial and error if I’d done it alone. I’m new to AI, but seeing it turn random knowledge and scattered resources into an organized project—it’s incredible. I wouldn’t have made this reality without it.

And Kenshi? It’s a fantastic game that invites endless tinkering. But here’s the truth: it’s old. What draws me in is the modding. So, to the modding enthusiasts out there—get organized, use ChatGPT, take the process of digging through info, and convert it into work you’re proud of. Doesn’t matter your weak spots—grammar, syntax, even ideas—just dive in. It’s like working with a thousand minds at once.

A quick note on limits: yes, there are free and paid versions depending on the scope of your project. I eventually upgraded because the free version helped so much that I knew I wanted more. So give it a shot, have fun, and dive into the possibilities.

Around a week inside, you’ve got 4 collections of mods, 2 updated collections of the one we got, and one that merges a couple together. Some articles on Reddit, a folder for mods off Workshop, install files like Vulkan, shaders, fixes, rules, load order—all spread across a ton of different sites.
